=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Dumper - (Deprecated) Needs implementing sanely

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Catalyst::Plugin::Dumper version 0.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Previous versions of this plugin injects a dumper() method into the
L<Catalyst::Log> namespace.

This has always been Evil and Wrong.

It needs writing correctly.

Until then, this module is deprecated.

Sorry.
